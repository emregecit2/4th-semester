\section*{Answer 1}
\paragraph{a)}
$N \geq 0.25(\frac{z_{\alpha/2}}{\varepsilon })^2$

$ 1 - \alpha = 0.99 \implies \alpha = 0.01$

$z_{\alpha/2} = z_{0.005} \approx 2.5758$

$N \geq 0.25(\frac{2.5758}{0.02})^2$

$N \geq 4146.716$

The size of the Monte Carlo study must be at least $N = 4147$.
\paragraph{b)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item$E(X)  = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda}$ for a Gamma distributed random variable $X$.
Substituting $\alpha = 190$ and $\lambda = 0.15$ we get:

$E(X)_{gamma}  = \frac{190}{0.15} = 1266.\overline{6}$

The expected value for the weight of an automobile is $1266.\overline{6}$\\

\item $E(X)_{gamma} = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda} = \frac{110}{0.01} = 11000$

\item Expected value for the total weights of all automobiles that pass over the bridge on a
day is equal to the number of automobiles that pass over the bridge on a day multiplied by the expected value for the weight of an automobile.

We know the expected value for the weight of an automobile is $E(X) = 1266.\overline{6}$.

The number of automobiles that pass over the bridge on a day is a Poisson random variable with
$\lambda = 50$.

$E(X)_{poisson} = \lambda = 50$

Expected value for the total weights of all automobiles that pass over the bridge on a day is:
\begin{center}
$50 \times 1266.\overline{6} = 63333.\overline{3}$
\end{center}

\item 
The number of trucks that pass over the bridge on a day is a Poisson random variable with
$\lambda = 10$.
Expected value for the total weights of all trucks that pass over the bridge on a day is
\begin{center}
    $10 \times 11000 = 110000$
\end{center}
\end{itemize}
\section*{Answer 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Probability that the total weight of all the vehicles that pass over the bridge on a day is more than 200 tons = 0.225464
    \item Estimated total weight = 173324.013013
    \item Standard deviation = 36312.385849
\end{itemize}

For testing the accuracy of the estimator of the total weight of all the vehicles, we will construct a $\%99$ confidence interval.
\begin{center}
    $\hat{\theta} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\cdot s(\hat{\theta})$

    $173324.013013 \pm 2.5758 * \frac{36312.385849}{\sqrt{4147}}$

    $173324.013013 \pm 1452.4$

    $[171871.56731, 174776.45872]$
\end{center}
A confidence interval of $\%99$ only has a margin error of 1.4 tons, that is very small with compared to 173.3 tons, only a $\%0.84$ margin error. This margin also includes the expected value we have calculated. We can conclude that our estimator is pretty accurate.
